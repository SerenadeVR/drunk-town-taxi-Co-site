## 🎮 About The Game
**Drunk Town Taxi Co.** is a chaotic, physics-based VR taxi simulator inspired by arcade classics. You play as the designated driver for a city that never stops partying. 

Your mission is simple: Pick up passengers who are too inebriated to walk and get them to their destination. The catch? The physics engine is fighting you, your passengers are ragdolling across the backseat, and the clock is ticking.

### ✨ Key Features
* **VR Driving Mechanics:** Hands-on steering and interaction within the cab.
* **Ragdoll Physics:** Passengers aren't just static models—they tumble, flop, and react to your driving. Take a corner too hard? Check your rearview mirror to see them flying.
* **Time Attack Mode:** Race against the clock to deliver as many fares as possible before time runs out.
* **The "Drunk" Factor:** Manage unpredictable passenger behavior while navigating a stylized city environment.

## 🛠 Technical Info
* **Engine:** Unity
* **Platform:** VR (OpenXR)
